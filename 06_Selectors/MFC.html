    <p>There are times when you can just feel the tectonic plates of history moving beneath your feet.

        Time and again the entire direction of the club has revolved around a single epoch-defining game. Famous firsts.
        Pivotal promotions. Ruinous relegations. Near misses. Cup glory. European adventures. Collapse into chaos.
        Legends born and dreams shattered. Boro’s proud past is peppered with folklore fixtures heavy with history.

        ‘The Games That Shaped The Boro’, the brilliant new book by club author Anthony Vickers, tells the gripping,
        in-depth story of those sliding doors moments that have changed the club forever.

        The story starts with an embryonic Victorian club’s bitter battle to survive and flourish and unfolds through
        two teams packed with potential denied glory by the outbreak of war, and into the modern age of the Ayresome
        Angels, Charlton’s Champions, liquidation, the Rioch revival and the Riverside Revolution.</p>

    <p>The journey goes via the seminal matches that cemented the legends of Camsell, Mannion and Clough and takes in
        the FA Cup heartbreak at Wolves that scarred a generation and started a slide to liquidation, the emotional
        highs of the Battle of Stamford Bridge, the game-changing Carling Cup triumph at Cardiff and the historic
        high-water mark of the UEFA Cup final at Eindhoven.

        All those seismic shifts are relived through contemporary match reports, club minutes and revealing eye-witness
        accounts from the people who were at the heart of the action.

        This engaging, entertaining and informative account of the historic moments when the tides turned is essential
        reading for every Middlesbrough supporter with a thirst for our history. </p>

        <p>One is suspected as being the person discharging a pyrotechnic in the South Stand, while the other used foul and
        abusive behaviour towards a number of stewards.

        Both individuals have been notified in writing from the club.

        A further individual was arrested at the Stoke City game for the use of a pyro within the visitors section.

        The club has a zero-tolerance policy and would remind fans that there is no place for pyrotechnics, including
        flares, smoke bombs and fireworks, in our stadium.

        Anyone found in possession of, or using these devices, will face a minimum three-year ban, in line with EFL
        guidelines, and such incidents will be reported to the police.</p>
